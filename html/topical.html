            <h3>The use of AI-generated images have already been used in the U.S election campaign leading up to the coming 2024 Presidential Election.
                In 2025 Norway will host its Parliamentary Election, how should we prepare for the use of this technology?
        
               </h3>
            <p class="hoved-tekst">Due to the importance of who wins the election and the resulting political attitudes and actions we see in society, a regulation/ban law should take place before the next election.

                It should be based on an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the law. (Include all factors such as political actors, voters, research and development.)
               
                If there is a threat to the integrity of the election linked to the use of AI campaigns, it may be important to carry out temporary changes or measures.
               
                After an election, we often learn about a political issue from one of the parties, often the party that is the largest and wins the election.
                A political issue that would have made people vote differently. In the aftermath of an election, if AI is not banned during the election period, we can probably imagine that future elections will be characterized by AI-generated content after the election.
                 The largest party, i.e. the winner, generates political content for parties other than themselves, so that they themselves do not receive as much criticism and doubt directed at them after the election when they enter government.

            <h4 >What might be unintended consequences?</h4>
            <p class="hoved-tekst">Overwhelming control can cause unnecessary censorship, e.g. "AI-detection" technology can still get it wrong and end up censoring campaigns that don't use AI-generated content
                A frequent error from AI-detection technology can lead to a lack of trust among political actors and voters.
                 If campaigns experience unfair censorship due to technological errors, it can undermine trust in both the electoral process and the use of AI in politics.
