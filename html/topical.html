                <p class="hoved-tekst">
                    Overwhelming control can cause unnecessary censorship, e.g. "AI-detection" technology can still get it wrong and end up censoring campaigns that don't use AI-generated content
                    A frequent error from AI-detection technology can lead to a lack of trust among political actors and voters.
                    If campaigns experience unfair censorship due to technological errors, it can undermine trust in both the electoral process and the use of AI in politics.

                    Politicians and political parties can lose from the use of AI, or more specifically, politicians who do not use AI to disinform.
                    Freedom of expression: ban on AI content limits freedom of expression for those who want to express their political opinion. Politicians and political parties who want to manipulate voters to increase by using a strong and effective tool, AI.
                    Using AI in the analysis of political trends and opinion polls can help researchers and analysts better understand voter behavior,
                    identify patterns and provide more accurate predictions.
