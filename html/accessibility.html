In order to enhance the accessibility for individuals who cannot read or see, we have replaced the generic alternative text with more descriptive options, making it better when using the text-to-speech.

        <p>"Accessible means a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions,
            and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use. 
            The person with a disability must be able to obtain the information as fully, equally and independently as a person without a disability. 
            Although this might not result in identical ease of use compared to that of persons without disabilities, it still must ensure equal opportunity to 
            the educational benefits and opportunities afforded by the technology and equal treatment in the use of such technology.",
