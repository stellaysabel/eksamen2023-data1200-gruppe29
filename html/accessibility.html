                <p>Accessibility refers to the design and implementation of websites or software applications that can be used by people with disabilities such as blindness or decreased capebilities.
                When making a website you can make sure that, almost, all of your potential visitors, including those with disabilities, have a good user experience and can easily access the information
                by making your website accessible. When the website is designed with accessibility and universal design in mind, it also becomes more user-friendly for all users. This is why we choose to implement ...</p>

                    <p>After connecting our website to the accessibility test, we identified two alerts: "A nearby image has the same alternative text." The alt for all images was set to "campus." In order to enhance the accessibility for individuals who cannot read or see, we have replaced the generic alternative text with more descriptive options, making it better when using the text-to-speech. This update has been applied to all of our images. Now the only alerts are the photo images, which are from the same source.</p>

                <h3>Accesibility Testing</h3>
                <p>An automated test evaluates a website's usability and accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities, by analyzing several features of the site. The test looks for things like the design's responsiveness, consistent design, error handling, link descriptions, etc. The automated test ensures that websites are accessible to users of all abilities by looking at these points, helping to create a more inclusive digital environment.  
                <p>When embarking on the development of our website, we adopted a strategic approach to crafting the CSS, opting to initially focus on the display for mobile phones. This deliberate choice was driven by the rationale that commencing at the smallest screen size would provide a solid foundation before progressively scaling up to accommodate larger devices, such as tablets (e.g., iPad) and desktop computers. </p>
                <p>Drawing inspiration from contemporary web design practices, a notable example being the website vilbli.no, we recognized the efficiency and effectiveness of starting with the mobile display. By doing so, we aimed to streamline the development process, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience across various devices. </p>
                <p>This methodology enables us to prioritize the mobile user experience, acknowledging the widespread use of smartphones for web browsing. Once the mobile layout is finely tuned, we intend to employ media queries to systematically enhance and optimize the presentation of content for larger screens </p>
                <p>This meticulous and iterative approach not only aligns with industry best practices but also reflects a commitment to user-centric design. As we progress through the development stages, the adaptability of our design will be a key consideration, ensuring that our website remains visually appealing and functional across the diverse landscape of devices utilized by our audience.
